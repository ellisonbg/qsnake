Qsnake
------

Qsnake is a free open-source electronic structure software licensed
under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source
packages into a common Python-based interface.

Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Gaussian,
Castep, Gamess, Wien2k and Vasp.

Compilation
-----------

$ cmake .
$ make

Installation
------------

First set the installation prefix during the cmake run:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/xx .

And then just install it:

$ make
$ make install

Licensing
----------

The qsnake core is BSD licensed when used as such. When distributed with all
the third party packages (batteries included) it becomes GPL, due to some
packages being GPL.

Tests
-----

Tests are executed by:

$ ./test

Currently we only interface abinit. However, we should interface all
interesting opensource programs. Here is a (not exhaustive) list:
